# Optoelectronic Material Analysis and Bandgap Prediction

A beginner-friendly research project for analyzing semiconductor and optoelectronic material data using Python. The project includes UV-Vis absorbance analysis, Tauc plot based bandgap extraction, photoluminescence peak analysis, I-V characteristics of optoelectronic devices, EQE response visualization, and a simple machine learning model for bandgap prediction.

This repository is suitable for research internship applications related to materials science, optoelectronics, semiconductor devices, energy devices, and experimental data analysis.

## Project Motivation

Optoelectronic and energy devices such as solar cells, LEDs, photodetectors, and semiconductor thin films require careful analysis of experimental data. Common characterization methods include UV-Vis spectroscopy, photoluminescence, current-voltage measurement, and external quantum efficiency analysis. This project builds a clean Python workflow to process such data and extract useful material/device parameters.

## Methods Used

### Tauc Plot Bandgap Estimation

For a direct bandgap semiconductor, the Tauc relation is commonly written as:

```text
(alpha * hν)^2 = A(hν - Eg)
```

where:

- `alpha` is the absorption coefficient
- `hν` is photon energy
- `Eg` is the optical bandgap
- `A` is a material-dependent constant

A linear fit is performed near the absorption edge. The x-axis intercept gives the estimated bandgap.

### ML Bandgap Prediction

A Random Forest Regressor is trained using synthetic material descriptors such as:

- Composition fraction
- Lattice constant
- Electronegativity difference
- Atomic radius difference
- Defect density
- Annealing temperature

The trained model predicts the optical bandgap and reports error metrics.
